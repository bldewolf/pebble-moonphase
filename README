This is a pebble moonphase app.  It starts at the current moon phase and you
can view coming/previous moon phases with the up/down buttons.  Pressing select
will return to the current day.

The moon phase calculation is a bit shoddy and doesn't account for time zones.

The moon image really turned out better than I thought it would.
